# Onion Juggler Workspace

This workspace contains examples of applications built using the Onion Architecture Juggler package. The examples include a web application, a desktop application, and a mobile application, each demonstrating the principles of Onion Architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open the Workspace**: 
   Open the `onion-juggler-workspace/onion-juggler.code-workspace` file in Visual Studio Code. This will load all the example projects into the workspace.

3. **Install Recommended Extensions**: 
   It is recommended to install the extensions specified in the `.vscode/extensions.json` file for a better development experience.

4. **Build the Solutions**: 
   Navigate to each example folder (`web-sample`, `desktop-sample`, `mobile-sample`) and build the respective solution files (`*.sln`) using your preferred method (e.g., using the command line or Visual Studio).

5. **Run the Applications**: 
   After building the solutions, you can run the applications. Each example has its own specific instructions for running, which can typically be found in the respective project folders.

## Example Applications

- **Web Sample**: Located in the `examples/web-sample` directory. This example demonstrates a web application built using the Onion Architecture principles.

- **Desktop Sample**: Located in the `examples/desktop-sample` directory. This example showcases a desktop application following the same architectural guidelines.

- **Mobile Sample**: Located in the `examples/mobile-sample` directory. This example illustrates a mobile application built with the Onion Architecture.
